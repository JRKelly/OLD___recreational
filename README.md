BirdNonsense is a Monte Carol attempt at the following word problem:
There is a telephone wire of L length with n number of birds sitting on it. The birds move at all the same constant rate of speed, moving to the left or right randomly.. If the birds touch the telephone pole, they fly away instantly. If they touch eachother, they move in the opposite direction, no speed change. How long will it take for all the birds to fly away?

It's been simplified so that the birds' initial positions are evenly spaced and each time unit/iteration moves each bird L/n.
